	        <p>
	        	Thirty years ago, buying a house was a major event that required constant back and forth with realtors and sellers along with numerous appointments to see homes and complete the paperwork necessary to make it yours. Those old days are all but gone now as technology has made the home buying process as easy as ever for customers and real estate agents alike.

	        	<br>

	        	Now, buyers can complete just about every step of the home buying process at the touch of a button, and most tasks can be completed without leaving home. If you are considering buying a new house, then you will likely be excited about these awesome innovations, including the ability to see more information about sellers, sign closing documents from anywhere, and how to view a home without stepping outside.

	        	<p>
	        		Web development is an ever-evolving process, always bringing something new to the market with each passing day. Among all the technologies, nodejs is something that is most used in web development. Its’ demand and use are increasing day by day and attracting more clients to shift to this technology. But what is specific in node.js that attracts businesses to invest in this technology. In this article, we will be shedding light on the features of nodejs that make it really great. Every nodejs development 	company puts great effort into hiring nodejs developers due to high demand. The reasons are described below: 
	        	</p>
	        	    <h3 class="updateheading"> What is Nodejs? </h3>
	        	    <p class="updatepara">
	        	    	Nodejs is an open-source, cross-platform that was first developed in 2009, Ryan dahl. It basically creates a run time to function outside the browser environment. It basically utilizes asynchronous programming.

	        	    	<br>

	        	    	It is built on JavaScript V8 engine so it can run in a large number of browsers including Chrome, Firefox, etc. NodeJS has the ability to handle large server requests seamlessly.
 
	        	    </p>
	        	    <h3 class="updateheading"> Functions of nodejs </h3>
	        	    <ul class="updatepara">
	        	    	<li>Collects form data</li>
	        	    	<li>Generates dynamic page content</li>
	        	    	<li>Adds, deletes, and alters data in the database</li>
	        	    	<li>Writers, reads, Designs and closes files on the server</li>
	        	    </ul>
	        	    <p class="updatepara">
	        	    	Below is the list of global enterprises that have shifted their businesses to NodeJS:
	        	    </p>
	        	    <ul class="updatepara">
	        	    	<li><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a></li>
	        	    	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	        	    	<li>eBay</li>
	        	    	<li>Walmart</li>
	        	    	<li>Mozilla</li>
	        	    	<li>Yandex</li>
	        	    	<li>Citibank</li>
	        	    </ul>
	        	    <h3 class="updateheading">Features of Nodejs</h3>
	        	    <ol class="updatepara">
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Cross-platform compatibility</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		Nodejs is highly compatible when integrated with Windows, Unix, Linux, and mac os. Nodejs is also highly suitable for mobile platforms. To make a self-reliant package, it can be bundled with the correct package. This makes nodejs one of the best technology to choose for cross-platform suitability. 
	        	    	</p>
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>One Coding Language Usage Convenience.</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    			The best thing about the nodejs is that it can be learned very quickly if anyone is experienced with Javascript. With nodejs, a developer can easily use the same coding language for both front-end and back-end work. This is the reason its popularity is surging with each passing day. It provides convenience to each developer due to the need of switching to multiple coding languages, to make oneself capable of dealing with fewer files. 
	        	   		</p>
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Scalable</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		NodeJs solves one of the most common problems that often come in software development – scalability.  Businesses nowadays prefer to build scalable software. The scalability of the nodejs is unmatched when compared to other technologies. The nodejs takes the concurrent requests.  Another reason that makes the nodejs more scalable is that they can handle load balance without much complexity.  Scalability is the core reason why nodejs development companies prefer nodejs for web development. 
	        	    	</p>	
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Cross-Platform </h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		If we keep java aside for a minute, nodeJS is not just cross-platform but also more functional when developed with the correct executable structure. It is highly commendable to provide additional compatibility for cross-platform. 
	        	    	</p>	
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Speed and Performance</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		The speed and performance of input-output operation make the nodejs runtime environment, one of the most rapid options. The core runs quickly, deploys quickly, and amplifies the entire run time environment. The key component of choosing nodejs instead of other technologies is that it runs on the Google v’8 Javascript engine. The apps built with nodejs are end to end made in javascript. It improves the overall speed and performance of the app rapidly. 
	        	    	</p>	
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Efficient caching</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		If a debate about the pros and cons of nodejs running, then caching feature is always that gains attention. The nodejs has the powerful ability to cache the data without any delay or inconvenience. Once you made a request to the app about the caching need, they are cached in the app memory. Once this execution and re-execution happen, again and again, the nodejs still do not get slow by the historical data. This is extreme.
	        	    	</p>	
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Reusable code </h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		Just because of the use of javascript as one of the roots of programming languages. It’s’ easier to transfer the part of codes to the different components of the system. A nodejs developer can use the same part of the code for both the front end and backend anytime. The code reusability makes it one of the best advantages of nodejs.
	        	    	</p>	
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>Node package manager</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		Node package manager better described as npm does quite important things.  It works as an online repository for publishing any kind of open-source Node.js project. 
	        	    		<br>
	        	    		Also, the command-line facility is highly used for setting communication with that repository, package installation, and dependency management, etc.
	        	    		<br>
	        	    		The nodejs package manager is most used to publish, discover, install Node programs. At last, it helps the developers to make the best use of nodejs tools and technologies.  
	        	    	</p>	
	        	    	</li>
	        	    	<li>
	        	    		<h4>IoT Application Development</h4>
	        	    	<p>
	        	    		When it comes to IoT application development, the use of IoT is increasing with each passing day. Since the evolvement of nodejs, the public, and private IoT solutions systems are also increasing. Seamless concurrent requests with thousands of events are easily processed with nodejs development for billions of devices on its network. 
	        	    		<br>
	        	    		The event-driven server architecture and ease to process relevant I/O operations on IoT networks is a unique feature of nodejs. Also, the nodejs can easily.
	        	    	</p>
	        	    	</li>
	        	    </ol>
	        	    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
	        	    <p>
	        	    	Nodejs is one of the best technology for web and mobile app developments, for futuristic development. Considering the above points if you want to hire Nodejs Development company, it would be good to invest due to the promising features of nodejs.
